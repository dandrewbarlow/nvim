# [NVIM Dotfiles](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow/dotfiles/nvim/README.md)

## Description

These are my `neovim` configuration files. They've gone through numerous
revisions through the years, and are likely to undergo more. I began building
up my config w/ `Plug`, then was wowed by `NVChad` as a plug&play alternative,
before deciding that I wanted more control over my config, and was willing to
learn in order to do it.

My current goal is to make `neovim`:

1. sleek
3. powerful
4. intuitive

using the more modern options uniquely available to `neovim`, and avoiding any
plugins that:

1. have excessive scope
2. I don't understand
3. have more feature rich successors

Some of these goals compete with each other and all have their own exceptions
I've made, e.g. to take an 'a la carte' approach and avoid monorepos, I'm
making myself rtfm more to avoid installing plugins that go over my head, or
avoided very cool plugins that I don't feel are ready yet. All this to say if
anyone wants to copy my dotfiles, feel free, but as always be aware that I
arrived here through a process of trial and error, and personal fine tuning.
Milage may vary.
